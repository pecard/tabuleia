## What is tabulEIA?

tabulEIA provides an exhaustive list of species occurring at a given area of interest. 
It does so by retrieving pre-compiled data from many sources: fieldwork, eBird, iNaturalist, 
Flora-on, Atlases, Regional databases, EU reports. Lists are provided with taxonomic 
and conservation status and will be ready to be used in EIA report.
Data being retrieved from:

- Field inventories
- Atlases (mammals, birds, Amphibians, Reptiles, Orchids)
- Flora-on database
- eBird (5 minute min. census)
- iNaturalist (research grade records)
- Natura 2000 Report

## Installation

## Usage

Run a basic example:

``` r
library(tabulEIA)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(geotidy)

# Copy geometry directly from QGIS wkt
pol <- st_geomfromtext('Polygon ((-8.2522 37.8960, -8.2513 37.8960, -8.2513 37.8951,
                       -8.2522 37.8951, -8.2522 37.8960))')
pol <- st_as_sf(pol) %>% st_set_crs(4326)
utm_all = utm_id(grid = utm10k, roi = pol, buff = NULL, contiguity = 'queen')

# Flora
# inventories from field work
dados_campo <- read.delim('~path_to_my_field_data/fielddata.txt')

tflora <- tabulEIA::tabulFlora(fielddata = dados_campo, utm_ae = utm_all$ae, utm_q = utm_all$contig,
                               biblio = 'all')
# Avifauna
tave = tabulEIA::tabulAve(fielddata = NULL, utm_ae = utm_ae, utm_q = utm_contig, atlas = atlas_aves, ebird = ebird)

```
